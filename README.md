prediction-website-api

Second JS Project Using Frontend APIs (React Mockup)

You are asked to implement a full functional website: Prediction Website
The website aims to predict the gender, age and the nationality of a given name.
Everytime the website is loaded, it should show a random dog image.
The user has to input his/her name on the website and click on a button
Once button clicked, you’re going to fetch three apis (one to get the predicted gender, one for the age, and one to get the predicted nationality - you might get two nationalities with different probabilities - show them both)
Design the website the way you want but you should make it responsive and “cute”.
The whole project should be one page based.
You are not allowed to use axios. You have to use the fetch() function.
The api for getting the gender is: https://api.genderize.io?name=rio
The api for getting the age is: https://api.agify.io/?name=nour
The api for getting the nationality: https://api.nationalize.io/?name=mohamad
The api for getting the dog images: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
